Building Blender from Source
============================

.. _development-setup-buildblender:

As a developer, there are a number of advantages that come from building from source.
 * Avoid having to wait for bug fixes from full releases
 * Building the latest version to test compatability early
 * Testing new features and how we can integrate with them
 * Blender can be built as a python module, which can improve IDE integration.

The Blender code repo is also managed by git, allowing ease of integration into our workflow.
There are some additional prerequisite utilities that need to be installed first.

See - https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Building_Blender

The repo comes with scripts which will package up the plugin for use


Building the Blender Nif Plugin
