Integration Test Design
=======================

.. _development-testframework-design-integration:

Test Template
-------------

For every feature, first, a test should be written.

The following process is followed:

#. Create a new python file to contain the feature test code. 
   For example, if the feature concerns *x_feature*, the test case
   would be stored in ``testframework/test/../../test_x_feature.py``.
   
#. Derive the test class from :class:`test.SingleNif` and name it :class:`TestXFeature`.
   :class:`test.SingleNif` is designed upon the template pattern and takes care of all execution, loading of files and clean up.
   
   .. Note::
      A template for a test class is available in ``testframework/test/template.py``.

#. Each test needs to overwrite the following methods from :class:`test.SingleNif`

   * The :meth:`n_create_data` used to create the physical .nif
   * The :meth:`n_check_data` used to test the data of physical .nif
   * The :meth:`b_create_data` used to mimic how the user would create the objects. 
   * The :meth:`b_check_data` check Blender data, used to check before export and after import.
   
These methods are intended to be delegate function, calling external methods in either n_gen_xxxx or b_gen_xxxx files.
   
   * We move all the code to external modules for code reuse code to avoid importing other tests, avoiding tests to be re-run unnecessarily.
       

Test Implementation
-------------------
   
Each test has two paths of execution one importing/export a python generated nif, the other exporting/importing a nif created by mimicking how a user would create it.
Each test can be comprised of multiple required features and a lego block-building approach should be taken to building the nifs.

#. Recreate the nif using python:

  - Create a nif (say in nifskope, or with the old Blender nifscripts).
    Take care to make the file as simple as possible.

  - Use PyFFI's ``dump_python`` spell to convert it to python code.
  
  - The :meth:`n_create_data` method of the class will call the methods 
    from :mod:`n_gen_x_feature` module to construct the physical nif.
    It may be required to call other reusable functions from other tests.
    Reusable functions should be created from the dump_python and stored in ``testframework/test/../../n_gen_x_feature.py``.

 - Write code to test the desired features of the physical.
   The :meth:`n_check_data` method will call the methods 
   from :mod:`n_gen_x_feature` module to check the nif data.

#. Recreate the feature within Blender, using user functions:

  - Write Python code which recreates the corresponding data in the Blender scene in ``testframework/test/../../b_gen_x_feature``.
    
  - Where possible make the test case as simple as possible. For
    instance, use primitives readily available in Blender. This code
    goes in the :meth:`b_create_data` method of the test class.

  - Document the feature in ``docs/features/x_feature.rst`` as you write
    :meth:`b_create_data`: explain what the user has to do in Blender in order
    to export the desired data, and wherein Blender the data ends up
    on import.

  - Write Python code which tests the Blender scene against the
    desired feature: :meth:`b_check_data` method of the test class.

#. Now implement the feature in the import and export plugin, until
   the regression test passes.

That's it!

Execution Order
---------------

The tests will run like this:
   
User Export
***********

#. :meth:`b_create_data` to create the scene, saved to ``test/autoblend/../../x_feature_userver.blend``
#. :meth:`b_check_data` to check it before export
#. Export the nif to ```test/nif/../../x_feature_export_pycode.nif``
#. :meth:`n_check_data` to check exported nif.
   
User Import
***********

#. import the exported nif, saved to ``test/autoblend/../../x_feature_userver_reimport.blend``
#. :meth:`b_check_data` tests the imported scene.
   
If the above tests run, then we are in pretty good shape as we can verify import and export work in isolation 
  
Python generated Import / Export
********************************

#. Starts by :meth:`n_create_data` creating a physical nif ``test/nif/../../x_feature_py_code.nif``.
#. :meth:`n_check_data` is called to ensure nif is correct before importing.
#. Nif is imported into Blender, the scene is saved to ``test/autoblend/../../x_feature_pycode_import.blend``
#. :meth:`b_check_data` is called on imported scene to verify scene data.
#. Nif is exported to ``test/nif/../../x_feature_export_pycode.nif``
#. :meth:`n_check_data` on exported nif to verify nif data.

This ensures data integrity both at Blender level and at nif level.
